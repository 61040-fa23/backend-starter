# Concept-Driven Backend framework

## Inspiration
Didn't like the way I coded this project: [Fritter](https://github.com/BarishNamazov/fritter).

## Goals
Make development based on concepts as taught in [6.1040](https://61040-fa22.github.io/schedule) easy.

## Philosophy
For now, see [thoughts](https://github.com/BarishNamazov/conception/blob/main/thoughts.md), but might add to here more later.

## TODOS
- [X] Basic base for defining concepts and routers.

- [ ] More examples of concepts under `src/concepts/`, making a simple app.

- [ ] Move methods for defining concepts, creating routers, etc. to decorators. See [#1](https://github.com/BarishNamazov/conception/pull/1) for rough idea.

- [ ] Using decorators again, make actions work with the contents of request directly rather than deal with `req` and `res`.

- [ ] Implement singleton concept base (i.e., easy user has only one of that object).
